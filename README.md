# odin-recipes
# I have started learning fullstack development again from scratch
# to revisit and strengthen my foundations. 
# I have chosen to use a single resource, The Odin Project, as my main source of instruction.
# This is my first project in the course.
# Here, I will demonstrate very basic HTML5 skills.
# I will also use basic cli commands to navigate and manipulate the file system, and basic git commands to practise version control.
# This project shows my understanding of the HTML foundations part  of the course.
# The boilerplate code in all html files is written manually, and not generated automatically in the text editor(VS Code).
